This short guide presents one of many ways to structure small to medium home and
enterprise IP networks. A special focus lies on low complexity, support for
privacy preserving technology and good network and endpoint security.
Especially:

- The network works with end-to-end encrypted connections without modifications
  on the endpoints (no mandatory proxies, no custom certificate authorities).
- The network works regardless of whether endpoints use their own stub resolvers
  or third-party DNS services, it works for validating resolvers (DNSSEC) and
  it works for endpoints and applications using DoT and DoH (no split horizon
  DNS).
- The network allows endpoints to make use of IPv6 privacy extension or similar
  anti-tracking measures.
